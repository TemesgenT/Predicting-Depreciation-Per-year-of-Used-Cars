# Predicting-Depreciation-Per-year-of-Used-Cars
Used vehicle pricing is hard to get accurate prediction because the depreciation rate is not uniform to all cars, even cars produced from the same manufacturer. Finding the depreciation rate per year for each specific car reduces the price prediction error.
